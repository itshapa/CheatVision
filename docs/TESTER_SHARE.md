# CheatVision Tester Share

Private tester file sharing is provided by a dedicated Cloudflare Worker backed by a dedicated R2 bucket.

- Portal: https://cheatvision-share.sensoredrooster-com.workers.dev
- R2 bucket: `cheatvision-share`
- Storage is separate from the project's support-diagnostics R2 bucket.
- The bucket itself remains private; downloads and uploads pass through the authenticated Worker.

## Roles

**Tester**
- Browse and download files.
- Upload to `Tester Uploads`, `Screenshots`, `Bug Reports`, and `Logs`.
- Cannot upload releases, archive files, delete files, or change the Latest build.

**Admin**
- All tester capabilities.
- Upload to every folder.
- Upload releases.
- Mark a release as **Latest**.
- Delete files and clear the Latest pointer when the selected file is removed.

## Folders

- `Releases`
- `Tester Uploads`
- `Screenshots`
- `Bug Reports`
- `Logs`
- `Archived`

R2 uses object keys rather than real directories; the portal presents these prefixes as folders.

## Security

The repository contains only SHA-256 hashes of the high-entropy portal passwords, never their plaintext values. Login credentials are transported only over HTTPS and stored in a Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie for the browser session.

Login attempts and uploads are rate limited. Files are limited to 75 MB per upload. The Worker sets no-store and common browser security headers.

To rotate a password, generate a new high-entropy password, replace only its SHA-256 hash in `cloudflare/share-worker/src/index.js`, redeploy the Worker, and distribute the new password through a private channel.

## Deployment

The manual GitHub Actions workflow is:

`.github/workflows/deploy-share-portal.yml`

It creates the dedicated R2 bucket when needed, deploys the Worker, and verifies the public `/health` endpoint after deployment.

The syntax check workflow validates the Worker whenever share-portal code changes.
