# support fails with "Could not set video options ... I/O error", a hard
# mode-rejection (not a bandwidth/overflow signal, and not fixable by
# retrying or adding delays). Confirmed on real hardware: different
# resolutions have very different valid fps ranges on the same device (e.g.
# the development card's (AVerMedia GC573) bgr24 block only accepts 1280x720 at 50-60.0002fps,
# not 30fps as a generic ladder might guess), so candidates are generated
# per-resolution from the real advertised range rather than assumed values.
# Every common monitor refresh rate, fastest first, so a card advertising
# 1080p at 24-240 or a 165 Hz mode gets those offered and probed rather than
